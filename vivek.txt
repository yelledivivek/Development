Since I am a fresher, I am still learning. But I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner. 
I am always open to learn and unlearn at the same time.  I have some fresh and raw ideas that I would like to discuss 
with the management here if I make through and I am sure they will like a few of them. Hiring me can be a mutually 
beneficial arrangement for this company and me. I don't see why I cannot be hired for this job or internship.
